the nsa webserver allows you to do a couple of things:

* reports
--------------------
gives you charts for all configured
services, top5 monitoring on cpu/mem, etc..

* services
--------------------
allows you to add a specific service to monitor
that might not be in the default install; auto-creates
and installs a new cronjob, monitoring script so you
dont' have to guess whether something is working

* HOSTS *
--------------------
add/update hosts to monitor
