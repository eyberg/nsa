NSA

NSA is a two-part monitoring system borrowing the best
from both worlds that produces a hybrid onsite/offsite
monitoring system.

ONSITE
-----------------------------------------------------
I've looked at monit/god and they are damn good but I
haven't found a good non-hacky way to make sure it
works when I'm deploying 20 times a day besides
shutting it down in the morning and bringing it up
at night. Also, sometimes the control is not so
explicit.

OFFSITE
-----------------------------------------------------
I've used newrelic and hoptoad and they are damn good
but they don't inform me fast enough if my app is slow
or down. They also don't monitor everything I want to
see. I have a merb app, java app, a messaging queue --
you get the picture.

INSTALL ONSITE
-----------------------------------------------------
  1) cp onsite/monitor.rb /etc/cron.d/.
  2) cp onsite/30.cron /etc/cron.d/.
  3) change monitor.rb hostname/port in initialize block
  4) crontab /etc/cron.d/30.cron

INSTALL OFFSITE
-----------------------------------------------------
  1) sudo gem install sinatra haml datamapper
  2) nohup ruby nsa.rb 2>&1 /tmp/sin.log &


AUTOINSTALL
-----------------------------------------------------
 
just execute install.sh for an all-in-one install experience
(if you have your ssh-key in your path you should be good to go)

./install.rb


FUTURE FEATURES
-----------------------------------------------------

  * round-robin graphing for services
  * instant/txt msg/email for 'severe' warnings
  * user-defined instant reboot
  * production/development switches -- you don't want to have
    (instant reboot on a server you are deploying to 20 times/day)
  * auto-install/auto-configure for user-defined services
  * ability to edit from web interface rather than conf files
